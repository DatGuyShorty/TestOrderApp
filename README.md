# TestOrderApp
This app is being written as a side-project for better organization at work.
It is a WIP and more importantly a Python learning project.
Its a stepping stone for my programming journey, and hopefully one day it will lead to more interesting projects.


TODO

Better UI WIP
change the dropdown menus to a .csv file or other data format for cleaner code and easier user customizability

Implement a database for data storage instead of a csv file.
IDEA: SIDE APP for machine operators working on specific tests, allowing them to change the status of the order (setting up / running/ finished running/) with the record of date and time of an update.
